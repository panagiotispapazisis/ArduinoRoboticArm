For the program to work you need to import the libraries in the libs folder. The Arduino-List library was used to store the positions from the movement given to the robotic arm by the potentiometers in a power table, ie in a list. The ResponsiveAnalogRead library was also used for better reading of potentiometer values. Finally, for the movement of servo motors, the VarSpeedServo library was used. So for code to work on your Arduino you must first import these libraries into the Arduino IDE.
